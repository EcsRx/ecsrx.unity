# Simple Movement Example

So this example scene shows you how you can interact with unity based components from within the ECS system as well as the basics of:

- Setting up a scene using the `EcsRxContainer` object to create your own `AppContainer`
- Creating entities
- Creating and applying components
- Using different system types

Ultimately this is one of the easier starting points as it shows the minimum required to get something up and running in the unity world as well as how to resolve objects using the `[Inject]` attribute.
