# Random Reactions Example

So this example scene is slightly more complex as it shows you can react to changes on properties and trigger changes that way rather than polling every frame or other group level trigger.

It shows the basics of:

- Setting up a scene using the `EcsRxContainer` object to create your own `AppContainer`
- Creating many entities
- Creating and applying components with reactive properties
- Using different system types and reacting to property changes

This is still quite a simple example but it at least shows you how to react to changes and how you can express that within your components.
