# Blueprints Example

This scene shows the basics of working with blueprints to pre-define certain component setups for entities, this allows you to
quickly build up complex entities based off blueprints as well as being configurable enough for re-use.

- Creating blueprints
- Creating entities from blueprints

Blueprints are not mandatory and you can easily do all of this manually, however if you have the notion of a "Player" and want to
setup and entity to be a player it can save time this way as you have predefined the setup at the entity level without needing a 
system.
